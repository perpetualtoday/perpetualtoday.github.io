The event allowed students to showcase their amazing talents in dance, theatre and performing arts in the Dance Evolution, Musical play production and Jazz chant contests. Grade 12 students also dazzled all with their fantastic creations for their exhibits. The buzz of a lively campus made for a spectacular day.

Upon the opening of the Academic Fair, the program proceeds to its first activity in the morning which is the “Dance Evolution” competition. Each section performed different remixes of music that interprets the evolution of dancing accommodated with variety of costumes that bring the fusion of old and modern taste. Furthermore, every performance showed diversity of styles, from the music, the dance steps and overall show. With that, the activity had a powerful start thus also ending each performance excellently. The winners of the competition are STEM 3—Panday Pira that got 2nd place, STEM 2—Cayetano Arellano that got 1st place and lastly ABM—Emilio Aguinaldo, the Champions of the said competition. To top it all, the first activity was a success, everyone witnessed pure talent and entertainment made by the Grade 11 Perpetualites themselves.

The previous activity had an immense impact on everyone and it is certain that this activity did as well. Each strand conceptualized their own interpretation of the piece entitled “Rain”, everyone witnessed various unique and endearing renditions from the performers. Moreover, the whole activity started smoothly and each section performed according to the program thus also ending the activity with a thrill. Just like the first activity, this one is also a success. The winners of the competition are from ICT – Teodora Alonzo that got 2nd place, HUMSS- Apolinario Mabini that got 1st place and finally the Champion which is STEM 1- Andres Bonifacio.
