August 07, 2019, a little more than a month after the start of the semester and a week after students moving into the brand new building, it was officially blessed during the opening ceremony attended by teachers, administrators and staff of the University of Perpetual Help.

After observing the first Wednesday mass for the month of August, the priest and staff of the campus immediately commenced the blessing of the recently opened Senior High school Building, lighting candles, cutting ribbons and saying prayers for both the safety of the building and the students inside.
