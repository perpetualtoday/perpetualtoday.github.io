**Did you know that SARS-CoV-2's RNA sequence is about only 30 kilobytes big?** Let's put that into perspective.

![What does 30kb mean?](https://app.forestry.io/sites/wdy5emcayvxmew/body-media//assets/images/2020/03/31/graphic-20200331-30kb.png)

##### What is RNA, anyway?

DNA consists of four base-pairs; Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine. The order of these base-pair arrangements decides the characteristics of the living organism. RNA is a result of this DNA being _"transcribed"_; and in contrast to the two-stranded DNA, it only has one strand.

Several viruses have RNA, SARS-CoV-2 included.

##### So, how do 30 kilobytes look like?

In a photo shared with Reddit last March 18, one of its users transcribed the full 29.9 kilobytes of the virus' RNA sequence-based on data by the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI-NIH).

The image above shows SARS-CoV-2's **complementary DNA strand**, a strand synthesized from its RNA. The whole cDNA strand is 29903 base pairs long, totaling to about 29.9 kilobytes.

According to the user, it got the complementary DNA sequence and color-coded them based on each base pair. The **purple** parts show the Adenine, **red** is Guanine, **orange** is Thymine, and **yellow** is Cytosine.
