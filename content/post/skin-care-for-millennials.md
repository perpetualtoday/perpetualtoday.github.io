Being a millennial is like a rollercoaster ride. Balancing your studies and social life, your new-found freedom, dates, career, and gushing hormones. Too much to handle, right? And then comes another problem – skin care. You are still discovering what keeps your skin super happy and what makes it break out. Well, I may not make your life battles easy, but I can definitely help you ace your skin care regimen.

There's a basic three-step process to control oil.  Choose a salicylic acid cleanser,
Use an oil-free primer to control shine; and
Blot oil during the day using specialized cloths or tissues.

If you make a regular habit of sleeping in makeup, you can have an acne breakout or develop a bumpy rash called perioral or periocular dermatitis.

Exfoliate. You need to exfoliate only once or twice a week, using a relatively gentle product. Don't scrub (it won't help with acne or blackheads) and don't over-exfoliate.

Get the right acne products. If you have breakouts, try this approach: Wash your skin, use a toner, and then apply a medicated acne gel.

Don't share makeup. "Do you want to share your friend's germs?” as tempting as it is to try your friend's perfect new eye liner, get your own instead. Keep hands clean. 

One way to help your skin stay healthy is to protect it from dirt and too many germs. Wash your hands before you touch your face or touch up your makeup and regularly clean other surfaces that touch your skin, such as your phone.
Choose spray hair products. If you notice that your acne breakouts cluster around your hairline or places where your hair often brushes your skin, consider that your hair product might be to blame. 
Wear sunscreen. Pick an oil-free product, and look for cosmetics, like liquid foundation, that contain sunscreen.
Avoid tanning beds. Get a healthy bronze glow with a self-tanner. Tanning beds and sun tanning can set you up for early wrinkles and increased skin cancer risk later on.
Talk to a doctor. You might benefit from prescription cleansers and acne medication that can clear skin faster and more effectively than over-the-counter products. 

Being a teen should be fun. Take charge of your skin care with these tips, and soon a clear complexion will put a smile back on your face.
