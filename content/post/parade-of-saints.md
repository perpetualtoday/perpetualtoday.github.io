On September 10, 2019 the University of Perpetual Help System-JONELTA celebrates one of the most important events the “Parade Of the Saints”. The campus yearly celebrated it to acknowledge the different saints that we have. We also celebrate it to recognize and remember the founder of University of Perpetual Help System our beloved founder, Dr. Jose G. Tamayo.

The program started with a mass that was led by Rev. Fr. Romolo Bertoni, CSS. The priest was clearly astonished by the efforts made by each section to cooperate with the said event. After sharing meaningful words, the mass turned out to be a success. The students’ parents and the teachers had a visible mark of excitement on their faces and then proceeded with the parade as planned. Each classes were awarded with their excellent work in representing their assigned saints for this year’s Parade of Saints.
