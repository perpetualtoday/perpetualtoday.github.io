Some of the most important parts of a school or a learning institution are obvious, it's an approach to learning, how it instills principles in all its students, the values it prioritizes in order to prepare them for the future. However, one of the unsung heroes of school life is also in its very backbone, the students who make up the school population and year in and year out create a constantly changing atmosphere in the school itself. The students use their skills and knowledge to set the tone for what the school is and what it wishes to become.

Two such examples of these kinds of students are Karl Vargas and Thomas Lomarda, two students from STEM 1 - Diamond, and former BED students. Take a look as these two build the UPHS-GMA Campus block by painstaking block in the juggernaut video game entitled Minecraft.

While known as simply a children's game to some, Vargas and Lomarda spent more than two weeks recreating the entire campus by cross-referencing it with their own knowledge of the school along with resources available to them online.

According to them, as this is their last year in Perpetual GMA, they wanted to create this so that in their own special way, they may be able to contribute to the school. As students of UPHS-GMA that haven't seen our school for a long time ever since the pandemic began, and perhaps even for a while yet, this shows that students of UPHS-GMA are still very much attached to our home campus.

For impressively being able to create our second home from their own homes, hats off, and GG to Karl Vargas and Thomas Lomarda for their sensational work honoring Perpetual GMA!
