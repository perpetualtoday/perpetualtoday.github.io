_"Death by chili"_ may sound impossible, but it is certainly possible for beings brave enough to try **Dragon's Breath**, the hottest chili you can find today.

Mike Smith, owner of Tom Smith's Plants in Wales, United Kingdom, created a record-breaking pepper with aid from researchers at Nottingham University. However, it is not encouraged to eat this pepper, as it could be the last food a person may ever eat.

**How do spicy peppers like Dragon's Breath kill someone?** Let's begin with its _spicy_ facts: the Dragon's Breath is so spicy, it is 2.48 million in the **Scoville scale**, a measurement of capsaicin (the chemical in peppers that releases the _"spicy"_ sensation) in the pepper.

In contrast, the **Carolina Reaper**, the once-hottest pepper, is only about **1.6 million** in the scale. Standard military pepper sprays are **2 million.**

The Dragon's Breath is so spicy that it was kept in a sealed container when it went on display at the Chelsea Flower Show last May 23 to 27, 2017, the Daily Post reported.

Smith didn't intend Dragon's Breath to be eaten as part of a meal. Instead, he grew it so that it could be used as a topical numbing anesthetic for people who are allergic to regular anesthesia.
