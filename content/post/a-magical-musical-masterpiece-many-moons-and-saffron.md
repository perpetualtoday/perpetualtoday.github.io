+++
On March 5, 2020, both Grade 12 students of Arts and Design from UPHS-GMA campus and in UPHS-Biñan campus presented an astonishing performance as part of their final requirement for this school year.

The first theatrical play that was presented was Many Moons by Grade 12— Arts and Design from UPHS-GMA followed by the theatrical presentation of Grade 12– Arts and Design from UPHS-Biñan entitled Saffron. Both theatrical shows were held at the Performing Arts Theater, UPHSL. Students who watched the musical play were accompanied by the teachers to be guided along the way.

A seat depends on the ticket that you avail. Seats were separated through three different sections with different price. Tickets for VIP cost ₱100, tickets for patrons cost ₱50, and for the regular tickets cost ₱20.

The show was worth watching even when you bought any of the tickets, not because of the seat where you are in but, to the great students who portrayed and internalized their characters well, and of course to their directors who handled them. Grade 12 — Arts and Design students from UPHS-GMA and Biñan performed passionately that made their own performance a masterpiece.
