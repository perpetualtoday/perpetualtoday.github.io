In order to be familiarized in the working field, one must experience and observe how working in a specific setting is like, that’s why on January 10, 2020 officially started the Immersion program of the Grade 12—Home Economics (HE) students at Alta D’ Tagaytay.

On their first day, the first batch of HE students are from HE 1—Septarian, they attended orientations, was given a tour around the hotel and were given interviews for their upcoming duties. On the next day, they started their first duty on the hotel followed by the following days. However, because of the commotion regarding the eruption of Taal Volcano, their following duties were moved from February 16-21 and so on. During the 9th day of the Immersion, there will be an overnight session, since the 25th of February is a Holiday, their overnight session was moved to February 26-27 wherein they checked-in at 2pm in the afternoon and eventually checked-out at 12pm the next day thus ending the first batch of the Immersion. 

On Feb 28, 2020, the second batch from HE 2—Seraphinite started their part of the Immersion, technically like the first batch, the same process is repeated, 10 days of duties and a day allotted for orientations, interviews and tours. Constantly, the second batch finished on the 10th of March and was going to be proceeded by the 3rd batch however, due to the COVID-19 Outbreak, the Immersion has been put into a hold till further notice.

Moreover, the first and second batch had an opportunity to gain various skills and capabilities in their field by working on duties at the said venue as each day starts by looking for chances of learning different things with their fellow colleagues and of course as experiences may vary there will always be a spark of enjoyment. Overall, with the help of their Immersion Adviser Ms. Ramchelle Aive G. Quintano, the first and second batch of Grade 12—HE students from HE 1—Septarian and HE 2—Seraphinite successfully finished their Immersion with their heads up high.
