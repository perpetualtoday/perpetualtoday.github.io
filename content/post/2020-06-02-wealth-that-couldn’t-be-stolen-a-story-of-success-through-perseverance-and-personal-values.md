Perhaps one of the most unsung heroes in today’s society are those who choose to pursue a career in education. Those whose life's work is built upon building up others. One such person being our very own; freshly appointed Senior High School coordinator, Mr. Dante F. Ferranco.

From a simple starry-eyed child in the distant barrios of Romblon to becoming a successful high ranking administrator in the University of Perpetual Help System-GMA Campus, Sir Dante F. Ferranco tells the Perpetual Today team his story.

Born in the small municipality of Banton, Romblon, Sir Dante Ferranco enjoyed a joyful childhood with his 8 siblings and cousins, playing traditional Filipino games and going on adventures. However, aside from playing games, he also spent a lot of time being taught by his parents about values and discipline. Namely, the value of knowledge and education.

> “One of the most important things my parents ever told me was ‘Educate yourself because that is the only wealth that can not be stolen."

Perhaps it was this desire for education and self-improvement that set him on the path of teaching and educating others. This choice has made it so that he has been teaching for 21 years, all those years being in our very own Perpetual Help GMA Campus. Now, that's loyalty if I’ve ever seen it!

Before becoming the new Senior High School Coordinator, Sir Dante spent his time teaching Social Science and World History subjects in the Basic Education Department. When asked what his reaction was when he got offered the job as the SHS Coordinator we all know today, his response was “I was already the Junior High School Coordinator before, and I already received a few hints that there was a strong possibility I might receive the position. The job only has a few more responsibilities than my previous one and I happily said okay!”

With the school year just kicking off and many more months to come, Sir Dante would like to say this to the first-ever batch of Senior High School Students under his tutelage, “Learn to listen to and respect others. Act appropriately as a human that has been given the highest ability and avoid doing things you will regret later down the line. You are in an institution of learning and have a bright future ahead, so take advantage of it!”

There's still quite a bit of time left before the end of the school year, and with that, a lot of time to learn from Sir Dante F. Ferranco, a man who started from the humblest of beginnings to someone who has dedicated their entire lives craft into being a role model in character building for the generations to come.
