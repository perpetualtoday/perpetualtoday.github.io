The University of Perpetual Help System (JONELTA Campus) month's "Buwan ng Wika" celebration started and ended with an electrifying air of excitement as students of the SHS department showcased their presentations that they worked on and practiced the entire month of August.

This year’s Buwan ng Wika theme is focused on the variety of native languages in the country ​​because "if neglected, they can disappear forever", Virgilio Almario, Chair of the Filipino Language Commission (KWF), said Monday, July 29. “Why are we doing this? Because we want to recognize and prove that 130 indigenous languages ​​in the Philippines are an integral part of our country". This is all the pride of our theme. "Native Language: Towards a Filipino Nation,” Almario said at the flag raising ceremony of the City of Manila on Bonifacio Avenue. 

KWF leads the celebration with the theme "Wikang Katutubo: Tungo sa Isang Bansang Filipino" in accordance with Resolution No. 19-03 and in the celebration of International Year of the Indigenous Languages (IYIL) or Pandaigdigang Taon ng mga Katutubong Wika as declared by UNESCO. 

KWF said that preparation for this year's Buwan ng Wika started in 2013. Long term plans for 2013-2016 and 2016-2020 were rolled out to preserve Philippine languages. Republic Act 7104 states that KWF shall “formulate policies, plans, and programs to ensure the further development, enrichment, propagation, and preservation of Filipino and other Philippine languages.”

The Perpetualite ‘Buwan ng Wika' celebration also highlighted several cultural activities all over the campus with the help of the school heads, the teachers, faculty and SIKLAB, the Filipino Club Officers.

Several of the activities held last August 29-30 are as follows.

### Cultural Dance

SIKLAB wanted to make this year’s celebration truly memorable. According to John Paul Laudato SIKLAB’s President for Grade 11, “Students think cultural dances are important because they help keep a culture alive. People, especially Filipinos, have cultural dances as part of their traditions for hundreds of years, and there is value keeping that tradition alive. Cultural dances are important as they represent the true colors of the Philippine culture and passing it on to our generation, helps in preserving it.”.

Out of 14 sections who participated in the event last August 29, 2019, ICT 1 – Teodora Alonzo won the second place; HE 1 – Septarian got first place; and ABM 1 – Emilio Aguinaldo won the champion thanks to their amazing choreography and performance.

### Laro ng Lahi

Perpetualites also enjoyed playing the classic, cultural games played by children in the old times where gadgets haven’t existed yet. Airo Gil Pabelico, External P.I.O of SIKLAB said in an interview that “Cultural games, especially when played as teams, promotes teamwork, sportsmanship, self-confidence, and leadership skills. While not possible to get these games back to the mainstream, young Filipinos seeing these games should help them be encouraged to play them as well.”. 

The event happened the same day at the University’s Gymnasium at one in the afternoon. Each section has been represented by six members who competed for three games.

HUMSS 1 – Apolinario Mabini won the title of being the ‘overall champion’ due to their highest energy for this event.

### Spoken Poetry

According to Charles Joshua Sacdo, Grade 12 Vice President of Filipino Club, “spoken Poetry is important because it addresses student's critical thinking, democratic engagement, and empowers their voices through verse". This event made the spirit of being ‘Makatang Pilipino’ alive in every participant. STEM 2 – Cayetano Arellano got the second place, while ABM 1 – Emilio Aguinaldo won the champion.

### Tagisan ng Talino

To challenge the mind and measure the ‘Filipino’-ness in Senior High students, this year’s ‘Tagisan ng Talino’ was truly an exciting competition for the participating Perpetualites. According to one of SIKLAB’s members Ron Justine Omela, “such events encourage team work: students need to form teams while participating in quizzes, giving them an opportunity to hone their ‘teamwork skills’ and to know the cultural heritage of Filipinos.”

With an event held last August 30, Mr. Arche R. Tudtod, the quiz master, challenged the participating Perpetualites’ smarts about being a Filipino and knowing the language and roots of the Filipino. ABM 1 – Hackmanite bagged the 2nd place, STEM 2 – Cayetano Arellano got the 1st place, and ABM 1 – Emilio Aguinaldo getting the champion with 59 points.

### Infomercial

According to SIKLAB’s Angelica Salazar, “the month of August is a good way of renewing our Filipino spirit by supporting our cultural heritage. These plays don’t just tell stories about our society but also showcases our talents as people; and with the use of our local language, these musicals will truly captivate our senses, refresh our memories, help us recall our history, and remind us of the beauty of our culture and heritage.” The primary aim is to produce an infomercial, a commercial of some sorts, that will spread awareness of this year’s theme of giving importance to our country’s heritage. Out of ten sections, ABM 1 — Emilio Aguinaldo got 2nd place, HUMSS 1 – Apolinario Mabini got 1st place, and the champion was STEM 1 – Diamond.

Truly, this year’s Buwan ng Wika celebration was an exciting event that both started and ended with fun and an exciting glow.
