**Did you know that SARS-CoV-2's RNA sequence is approximately only 30 kilobytes big?** Let's put that into perspective.

\[TO DO: GRAPHIC\]

In a photo shared to Reddit last March 18, one of its users transcribed the full 29.9 kilobytes of the virus' RNA sequence based on data by the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI-NIH).

**What is RNA, anyway?** DNA consists of four base-pairs; Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine. The order of these base pair arrangements decide the characteristics of the living organism. RNA is a result of this DNA being _"transcripted"_ ; and in contrast to the two-strand DNA, it only has one strand.

Several viruses have RNA, SARS-CoV-2 included. According to the user, it got the RNA sequence (after it has been processed) and color coded them based on each base pair.

The image above shows SARS-CoV-2's **complementary DNA strand**, the strand synthesized from its RNA. The **purple** parts show the Adenine, **red** is Guanine, **orange** is Thymine, and **yellow** is Cytosine.

The whole cDNA strand is 29903 base pairs long, totalling to about 29.9 kilobytes.
