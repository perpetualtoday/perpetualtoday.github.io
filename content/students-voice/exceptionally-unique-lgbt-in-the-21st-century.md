The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex and Asexual (LGBTQIA) Community was initially formed to represent the people with unique gender preference as a whole and to seek for acceptance from the society that seemed to look at them as if they were different. The Community was founded with the purpose of getting their absolutely deserved equal treatment.

The institution became their voice because some of them are not confident enough to open up their gender preference to the public. The fear of them opening up is most of the time caused by the possibility of being judged by the society.

It is definitely a fact that some people have their minds open for people with these kinds of gender preferences but there are still some people that have their minds closed and some who are just unaware of the judgment that these people have to go through just to grasp their gender preference.

For some reason, people tend to judge them for the way they dress and how they look which makes them feel like they are not welcomed in our current society. The Philippines being a predominantly Catholic nation makes it difficult for some Filipinos to grasp the concept of homosexuality, but with the new age of liberalism and open-mindedness comes a more accepting view point of individuals who consider themselves as part of the community.

At the end of the day, the members of the LGBT community are still our fellow humans with an exceptional gender preference that by any means deserves to be respected and not looked at to be an unusual thing.
