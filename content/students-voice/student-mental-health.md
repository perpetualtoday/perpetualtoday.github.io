There is no question that schools should put a strong emphasis on students’ academics, and as members of the youth, we must persevere and work on improving ourselves and pushing our limits. The values we pick up during our time in school are valuable life lessons that will help us in the future. However, putting too much pressure on a student is nothing but detrimental and is overall counter-productive. Such a heavy workload from multiple subjects all at once causes an intense strain on the mental health of a student and does not allow them to grow, but rather pushes them down and causes great anxiety.

At a very young age, students suffer from stress that may lead to different psychological issues like depression and an ingrained sense of self-deprecation and low self worth. Complying with an unreasonable deadline and coming home late due to practices and group work in many subjects tends to cause issues within a family and strains the students relationship with their parents.

We as students should be tough and learn to handle deadlines and develop time management skills, however we should also learn to speak up when we know that we simply cannot keep up whilst maintaining our sanity. our grades matter, but in the long-term, it does not matter more than our mental health. We must learn to become educated, not learn to become robots.
