It's been over 2 years since Google introduced a new feature for Google Assistant, Google Lens. It has been rolled out to most devices right now, while a preview version is available on Google Lens for Google Pixel (or modded ROMs/devices).

But, how will Google Lens fare with... Fan arts? Will it be able to detect who's who? Let's start.

### Fandom 1: Sonic the Hedgehog

With Google Lens being a preview on my test device, finicky results are truly expected. And since I'm a fan of it, why not try this up? And results are... quite satisfactory.

But they're **official character models!** But what about, fan arts?

![¬©Ô∏è AIMF0324](/images/featured-post/post-1.jpg "Here it is, ladies and gentlemen. Sonic is a bull. üòÇ")

Albeit with one funny result, Lens would usually return with a *Couldn't recognize this image* yet on most fan arts.

But these ones, amazed me.

Google Lens was able to link these arts to the game from which they're based from. Even to the point of providing more information when needed.

But these ones, **left me wondering.**

##### Emphasis

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

##### Link
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[I'm a relative reference to a repository file](../blob/master/LICENSE)

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links. 
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes 
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

##### Code and Syntax Highlighting

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```
 
```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```
 
```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting. 
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

##### Blockquote

> This is a blockquote example.

##### Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it'll mostly work pretty well.

<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
</dl>

##### Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
